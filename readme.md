## Getting Started
Simply add [graphite.js](https://github.com/jonathandannel/graphite/blob/master/graphite.js) to your source directory and include it as a script in your index.html file. \

## API
`graphite` takes 3 parameters: `data`, `options`, and `element`.\
`data` should be an object with keys representing x-axis labels and the values representing the values of its corresponding bar.\
